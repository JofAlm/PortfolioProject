        Welcome to my portfolio! I am a passionate web developer with expertise
        in creating modern, responsive, and user-friendly web applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        My journey into the world of code started with a simple "Hello, World!"
        and has since grown into a full-fledged passion for building elegant
        solutions to complex problems. I specialize in the React ecosystem,
        including Vite and TypeScript, and I love bringing designs to life with
        Tailwind CSS.
      </p>
      <p>
        This portfolio itself is a testament to my skills, built from the ground
        up with a modern tech stack and connected to a Firebase backend for
        dynamic content management.
